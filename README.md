# Currency Converter Application / CCA - Swift
## Installation Requirements:
  - XCode Version: >= 15.4
  - iOS Version: >= 17.5
  - Device Tested: Iphone 15 Pro

CCA is a simple currency conversion application built in Swift. It utilizes API from [ExchangerateAPI.](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) to fetch newly updated rate each day.
  ## Infrastructure
  - Clean MVVM architecture
    
  ## Key Features
  - Smooth UI with an additional conversion history (Missing feature in default iOS converter)
  - Faster with caching system
  - Error handling (Invalid Inputs, No Network, Internal Code Errors)
  - Simple, easy to use

## Drawbacks
  - Lacking sufficient amount of Unit Testings
  - No complex UI to standout from majority of converters available on iOS AppStore

## How to run
  - Clone this repository https://github.com/Alakinnn/CurrencyConverterApp.git
  - Change directory into where it was cloned
  - Open "CurrencyConverterApp.xcodeproj"
  - Build the application in XCode with version 15.4 or higher

## Challenges
  - Developing the application while learning how to use XCTest

# Problem 2
## Installation Requirements:
  - XCode Version: >= 15.4
  - iOS Version: >= 17.5
  - Device Tested: Iphone 15 Pro

### Problem 2.1
  - Clone this repository https://github.com/Alakinnn/CurrencyConverterApp.git - Optional if you have cloned this previously
  - Change directory into where it was cloned
  - Open SubProblem1.xcodeproj
  - Modify test cases as needed in the setup method
  - Run the test case file
  

### Features
  - Added terminal UI for better visualization.

### Problem 2.2
  - Clone this repository https://github.com/Alakinnn/CurrencyConverterApp.git - Optional if you have cloned this previously
  - Change directory into where it was cloned
  - Open SubProblem2.xcodeproj
  - Modify test cases as needed in each testing function
  - Run the test case file

## Challenges:
  - The problem in this section comes under a "Project" file purely because I do not know how to create a swift file and run with the CLI like python or typescript
  - Another problem was making a single file wouldn't adhere to separate concerns of each file, thus making unecessary files that come along with project initialization
